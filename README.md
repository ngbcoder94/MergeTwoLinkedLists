# MergeTwoLinkedLists

Hello world, here is my work towards a LeetCode problem. 

The problem goes as follows: 

Merge two sorted linked lists in non decreasing order. 

Return the head of the list when finished.  

EX: L1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], L2 = [1, 2, 5, 6]
    Result = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Parameters: Node contains up to 50 nodes, and each node contains: -100 < node.val < 100.
